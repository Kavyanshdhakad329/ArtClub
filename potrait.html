                A portrait is a painting, photograph, sculpture, or other artistic representation of a person, in which
                the face and its expressions are predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, personality, and
                even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a snapshot, but
                a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows a person looking directly at
                the painter or photographer, in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer.

            <div class="text">
                A well-executed portrait is expected to show the inner essence of the subject (from the artist's point
                of view) or a flattering representation, not just a literal likeness. As Aristotle stated, "The aim of
                Art is to present not the outward appearance of things, but their inner significance; for this, not the
                external manner and detail, constitutes true reality."[1] Artists may strive for photographic realism or
                an impressionistic similarity in depicting their subject, but this differs from a caricature which
                attempts to reveal character through exaggeration of physical features. The artist generally attempts a
                representative portrayal, as Edward Burne-Jones stated, "The only expression allowable in great
                portraiture is the expression of character and moral quality, not anything temporary, fleeting, or
                accidental."

                Portraits are an artistic way of representing people. There are different modes of creating portraits;
                from traditional oil painting to sculptures, photographs, and other forms of media. In most cases,
                portraits show part figures, usually from head to shoulders, however, there is no restriction for having
                whole figures as portraits. They can be an individual portrait or a group portrait.

                Portrait photography is also known as portraiture. It is a kind of photography where the artist holds
                the camera upright in a way that the longer edge runs up and down; thatâ€™s a portrait orientation. The
                aim of portrait photography is to capture the essence and personality of the person or group being
                photographed, using several lighting effects, poses, and backdrops.
